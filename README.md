# Alorium Update Manager (aum) #

This Python script can be used to update the MAX 10 FPGA on the Alorium Technology XLR8 and Snō boards.
It is intended as a replacement for the dropdown menus and "Burn Bootloader" option 
used when updating the FPGA with the Arduino IDE. 

I wrote it to provide a way of updating the FPGA on XLR8 and Snō when using PlatformIO on VSCode for
project development with our boards. 

A few disclaimers:

* I am a reformed engineer focused on sales and marketing these days - not a full-time developer.
* Python is a new language for me.  I figured this would be a good learning exercise.
* This app is designed for Python 3 running on a Mac (macOS 10.12.6).  Feel free to change it for
other operating systems and/or versions of Python.  
* This tool is NOT a formally supported piece of the Alorium Technology toolchain.  It probably will 
become supported in the future - at least some version of it.
* If you are a hardcore Pythonic Code Enforcer, try to go easy on me.
